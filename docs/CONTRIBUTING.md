# Contributing

## How to participate
1. Assign yourself to an open git issue
    * To suggest a new feature or bugfix:
      *  Open github issue
      *  Label it accordingly
      *  Discuss with project members on discord or through github 
2. Create a branch with `<issue-number>-<branch-descriptor>` naming scheme [ *(see article)*](https://deepsource.io/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/)
3. Work on assigned issue
    * Try not to go outside the scope of the git issue
    * If too many changes are required for the git issue, then discuss with project members; a new ticket may need to be open
4. Once ready, start the [pull request process](#pull-request=process)

## Git workflow: Issue branch workflow
- Branches are created from issues/ tasks 
- Branches have the same name of its issue id#
- One Branch per issue and one issue per branch
